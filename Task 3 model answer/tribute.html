              <b>1815:</b> Ada Lovelace was born in London, England on 10th

              <b>Mid-1830s:</b> Lovelace collaborated with Charles Babbage
              around the mid-1830s on a mechanical general-purpose computer
              called the Analytical Engine which handled complex calculations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1843:</b> She recognized the broader applications of the
              Analytical Engine and published the first algorithm to calculate
              Bernoulli numbers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1852:</b> At the age of 36 on 27th November, Lovelace died from
              uterine cancer.

          <h2>After Life</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Lovelace's contributions were not widely recognized during her

            </li>
            <li>
              Ada Lovelace Day is celebrated annually on the second Tuesday of

        <blockquote>
          <p id="para1">
            The analytical engine has no pretensions to originate anything. It
            can do whatever we know how to order it to perform.

        <blockquote>
          <p id="mixed-border">
            Understand well as I may, my comprehension can only be an
            infinitesimal fraction of all I want to understand.

            That brain of mine is something more than merely mortal; as time
            will show.
